# Temperature-Servo-Control
The task here was to create a site page that displays temperature readings from a sensor on a chart and can adjust the angle of a Servomotor with a slider

The setup for this project includes:- ESP32 Microcontroller, Arduino IDE, DS18B20 Temperature sensor probe, SG90 Servomotor.

The project files were hosted on the ESP32's Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System (SPIFFS)

The information from the temperature sensor is sent to an online library called the highcharts library, after the data is processed the chart is then displayed on my webpage.

The frontend design is straightforward because the main fous is the incoming data.

i attempted to achieve the task in various ways and in doing so i have multipe site pages from mutiple attempts, i will be uploading all versions.
